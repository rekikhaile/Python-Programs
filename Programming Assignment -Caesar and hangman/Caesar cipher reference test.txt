Import this file in your program to test if your encrypt and decrypt functions are working correctly.

Make sure that the file your functions are defined in a file called 'caesar_cipher_template.py', otherwise the tests will not work. Also, make sure that both files are in the same folder.

After the 2 function definitions type:

import caesar_cipher_reference

When you will run the file in the Shell it will generate 30 random test cases for each function.

Note, that even if your function passes all of them, it is not guaranteed to be implemented correctly as the tests are randomized, but it should provide some confidence.
